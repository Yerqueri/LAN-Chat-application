# ChatApp
## Introduction
This is a LAN messaging App. All the people running this app on LAN, 
would be able to exchange private messages with their peers. This app doesn't use any external package except 
the frontend css and javascript package from [Materialize](http://materializecss.com).

## Building from Source
To build from source, download entire project, and node webkit version 0.12.2,
the latest at the time of releasing. Though used all the stable functions with
stability >= 3, so no problem should appear. And then execution is simply as

`$ path\to\nw\binary \path\to\package.json`

There are some ports used in this program, which should not be blocked by your Operating
System, and generally they are not blocked (tested on windows, ubuntu). These are 18160,21190,
and 21200. 

The working of this app is explained on the blog [here](https://codewidpranav.wordpress.com/2015/07/04/making-chatapp-messaging-app-made-with-nodejs-node-webkit-and-some-networking-concepts/).
